# Titanic-Survival-Prediction-with-ML
Using machine learning to predict whether a passenger will survive the titanic event

I will first use a single decision tree for this problem. After that, I will implement random forest and compare the two methods. 

Once I am done with decision tree implementation, I will use neural network and see how the two machine learning techniques perform differently.
